Task 1: Data Loading and Exploration (bank-full.csv)
Objective: To load and understand the bank marketing dataset.

Key Findings:

Loaded the dataset successfully.
Initial exploration revealed the dataset's structure and basic information.
Task 2: Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning Model
Objective: To prepare the data for machine learning modeling.

Key Findings:

Categorical features were preprocessed using label encoding and one-hot encoding.
Data was split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
Task 3: Decision Tree Model Training and Evaluation
Objective: To build and evaluate a Decision Tree model for predicting bank customer outcomes.

Key Findings:

A Decision Tree classifier was trained on the prepared data.
Model performance was assessed using classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC AUC score.
Hyperparameter tuning was employed to optimize the model's performance.
Task 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (US Traffic Accidents)
Objective: To explore and analyze the US traffic accidents dataset to identify patterns and trends.

Key Findings:

The dataset was loaded and initial exploration conducted.
Time-related features were extracted and cleaned.
Visualizations revealed:
Seasonal patterns in accident occurrences.
Weekday variations in accident frequency.
Time-of-day trends in accidents.
Distribution of accident severities.
Relationships between weather conditions, road conditions, and accident severity.
Further analysis can be conducted to delve deeper into the factors influencing accident occurrences.
